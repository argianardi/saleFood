# Sale Food

This project is a dashboard admin template for a point of sale application, which was sliced and cloned from a design in Figma. The template provides various UI components and layouts that can be used to build a dashboard for a point of sale application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The technology stack used in this project includes:

- ReactJS: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles that can be easily customized.
- Daisy UI: a component library for Tailwind CSS that provides additional UI components.
- React Icons: a library that provides a collection of popular icons as React components.
- Eslint: is a popular JavaScript linting utility that helps developers identify and fix issues with their code. It enforces a set of rules and guidelines for writing code in a consistent and maintainable way

## ‚ùì Why I Chose These Technologies

- ReactJS <br/>
  I chose ReactJS for this project because it can easily and efficiently build complex and interactive user interfaces. Additionally, this project does not require a significant focus on SEO, so there is no need to use a framework that supports Server-side Rendering (SSR). Implementing SSR would require additional server configuration and increase the complexity of the application.
- Tailwind CSS <br/>
  Tailwind CSS was chosen because of its simplicity and ease of use. It provides a set of pre-defined styles that can be easily customized to fit the needs of the project.
- Daisy UI <br/>
  Daisy UI was chosen because it provides additional UI components that are not available in Tailwind CSS. This library allows for the creation of more complex UI components without having to write custom CSS.
- React Icons <br/>
  React Icons was chosen because it provides a collection of popular icons as React components, which makes it easy to use icons in the application without having to manually create SVGs.
- Eslint <br/>
  Using ESLint can help in finding and fixing problems with javascript code. The Airbnb rules list provides an excellent starting point and can save many hours of work.
